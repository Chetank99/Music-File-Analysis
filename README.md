# Music-File-Analysis

Using the librosa library to:
-> Analyse the music input in terms of frequency of vocals(monophonic) and instrumental(stereo) part
-> Generating a music file which removes the instrumental part and leaves the vocal part only
-> Analyize the tempo and average BPM
-> Dynamic tempo estimation
